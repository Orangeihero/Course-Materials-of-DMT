            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This project derived from the author’s personal struggle with depression.</p>
        <p>In 2017, 1917 people in the Netherlands killed themselves by committing suicide. Inspired by his own
            experience of fighting suicidal tendencies, Sonja Kuijpers, from Studio Terp, visualized suicides in the
            Netherlands in 2017 in the form of a "landscape" on the basis of collecting relevant data and making charts.
            With a large data-art landscape and accompanying charts the author shows the data on suicide numbers of 2017
            from the Netherlands. Elements like trees, waves and clouds represent the categories of suicide methods. The
            cityscape leads into more traditional views, which in turn feel much more heavy.</p>
        <p>Depression is something to take very seriously. The author wishes people who want to end their lives could
            see or feel something that would change their mind. He wishes that people can all find peace by insight,
            appreciation, dealing with and hopefully enjoy living their lives, not by ending it.</p>

        <p>From the chart, we can see that the overall number of male suicides is more than that of females. The age
            groups where suicides are concentrated are from 40 to 50 years old and from 50 to 60 years old.</p>

        <p>You might be wondering what you are viewing here.This landscape, each element in it represents a person who
            committed suicide in the Netherlands in the year 2017. The left and right sides of this "landscape"
            distinguish the sex of the suicide. The left side of the "landscape" is male and the right side is
            female.</p>

                <p>Each category or method of suicide is represented by a certain element, while the tree represents
                    hanging , in other words, strangulation, the cloud represents taking drugs, alcohol or medicines,
                    the golden round illuminator represents suiciding in front of train or metro, water wave represents
                    drowning, the building represents umping from height, the gross represents other method, and the
                    star represents unknown method.</p>
                <p>In addition to using different elements to represent different ways of committing suicide, the same
                    category of
                    element represents the specific type of the element by distinguishing the shape of the element, for
                    example, the growth of trees is used to represent different age ranges.</p>

            <h2>Highlight</h2>
        </header>
        <p>What is so great about the project is that you’re viewing this beautiful graphic presentation and meanwhile
            realizing what you are actually looking at (the extent of the devastation).</p>
        <p>The originally cruel and desperate data becomes calm under the visual means full of natural images, but at
            the same time there is actually a certain conflict between this beautiful graphic presentation and the
            number of suicides it really represents. But this does not affect the expression of the image.
        <p>From this visual work, the overall representation of the number of suicides and their suicides through
            "landscape" provides the viewer with a holistic look and feel which does not make the viewer feel
            uncomfortable(the author did not use bloody or real pictures of suicide, but chose beautiful trees,
            buildings, and clouds to express various suicide methods). At the same time, the chart objectively shows the
            change in the number of suicides in the Netherlands from 2008 to 2017 and the comparison of suicides between
            men and women and the number of suicides in different age groups. It not only has the real expression of the
            objective data, but also gives viewer the direct perception and the concept of quantity.</p>

        <p>I have seen a lot of good cases on this website( <a

            Winners of the World Data Visualization Prize</a> )when looking for visualization cases.</p>
        <p>I did not used them because the description of Chinese territory are not correct in all the cases. but the
            visualization method and their design concept have certain reference value.</p>
